# Stretchy Pants #

**An off-the-shelf, ready-to-go project template for Ruby web-apps with user
management/authentication built-in. Uses the following projects:**

* Sinatra
* Mongoid
* Warden
* Mail
* Compass / HAML / SASS
* HTML5 Boilerplate

No fancy generators or slick Rakefiles, just clone, point Mongoid towards your MongoDB (local or MongoHQ) and *commence to hacking*. Slim it down or stuff it with pork, **Stretchy Pants** can adjust to fit.
